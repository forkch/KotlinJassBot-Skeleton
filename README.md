# KotlinJassBot-Skeleton

This is a KotlinSkeleton for writing a Jass bot for the https://github.com/webplatformz/challenge server.
Basically it chooses always Obeabe and does NOT play legal cards, it just plays random cards until it is not rejected by the server.

Right now it does not yet play a complete game. I'll look into that during the Hackathon :-)
